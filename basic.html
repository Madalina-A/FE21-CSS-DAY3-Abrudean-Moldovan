                You would like to use transitions and transformations in CSS3. 
            What different naming conventions exists?

                <dl>
                    <li>ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is the default)</li>
                    <li>ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start</li>
                    <li>ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end</li>
                    <li>ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end</li>
                    <li>cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function</li>

                Why is it useful to use services like caniuse.com?
            </b></p>
            <p>
                Caniuse.com is a website that allows us to search for whatever CSS method or attribute we want and make sure that the browsers support it.
                For example when looking for the term transform, we will immediately get recommended both the 2D and 3D transforms. 
                Both are usable for most browsers, so we can feel secure in using this technology for our project.

            <p><b>
                What are two kinds of elements in the flexbox model? What attributes do they have?
            </b></p>
            <p>
                Basically we are speaking about two different types of items in flexbox:<br/>
                The flex container (parent)<br/>
                The flex items (children)<br/>
                Flexbox consists of flex containers and flex items and defines how flex items are laid out inside a flex container. <br/>
                Inside a flex container there can be one or more flex items. <br/>
                Once an element is inside a flexbox container, it will follow the flexbox layout rules (instead of standard block & inline rules).

                Basic exercise | Testing Transition
            </h3>
            <p>
                Create a simple HTML document with multiple links to the developer's resources and tools. <br/>
                Use CSS3 transition effects on hover for these links to change, for example, their font size and color. <br/>
                Try to create your own resource page that you can update easily and use later in this course. <br/>
                Be creative and use as many resources as you can.<br/>
